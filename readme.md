A PHP demo site powered by the VHX API. Read more about the VHX API at our [Developer Docs](http://dev.vhx.tv).

## Getting Started

This PHP demo site uses [Laravel](http://laravel.com) as a foundation. We recommend following Laravel's [setup instructions](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/installation) for getting your local repo started. You can use this demo repo as a reference for integrating VHX.

We're using the [VHX PHP Client Library](https://github.com/vhx/vhx-php) (added via Composer). Specifics of the VHX integration can be found:

`app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`<br>
`app/Http/routes.php`<br>
`resources/views`
